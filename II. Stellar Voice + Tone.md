<h2>Why voice matters</h2>
Stellar’s voice is our personality or organizational personhood.

Successful products and organizations have a point of view. Maintaining a voice consistent with that point of view—not breaking character—is one way that we communicate clearly what we do, making our mission and technology accessible to the wider world. 

<h4>One voice, many tones</h4>
We have many different audiences: developers, nonprofits and foundations, financial institutions, end users. We take different tones when we speak to these audiences, but our voice itself is consistent—we should always sound like us. 

<h2>Who is Stellar?</h2>

<h4>Definitely <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w536Alnon24">here to make friends</a></h4>
To succeed at our mission of full economic participation for all human beings, Stellar must appeal to the world, transcending geographic boundaries, cultural differences, and class divisions. 

<h4>An open book</h4>
The cryptocurrency space is notoriously exclusive and opaque. By contrast, Stellar builds trust by welcoming a diversity of experience and cultivating openness and honesty.

<h4>Walking a tightrope</h4>
Consensus technology, financial inclusion, and financial literacy are complex endeavors. Stellar makes them accessible without sacrificing accuracy.  

<h4>Feel good for a reason</h4>
Warm and always substantive, Stellar's playful tone is welcoming but never crosses over into superfluous pep. 

<h4>What would the community do?</h4>
Stellar is mindful of the diverse circumstances faced by people living in underserved communities. We seek to be part of a concrete solution while understanding that we don't represent our primary audience.

<h4>There's an app for that</h4>
Stellar couples financial technology and digital financial literacy. We're building a movement, not an app. 

<h4>Public works</h4>
Stellar aims to improve the human condition but remains wary of “change the world” bravado. We're building infrastructure that works behind the scenes of local financial products and community initiatives.   

<h4>Like the Internet for money</h4>
Our ambition is to become a democratizing force, like the Internet. By enabling economic participation, we hope to create a waterfall effect—financial access can open gateways to education, healthcare, gender equality, and other human rights.  

<h2>Stellar traits</h2>

<b>Accessible</b> but not dumbed down

<b>Precise</b> but not wonky

<b>Purposeful</b> but not self-important

<b>Future-facing</b> but not intimidating

<b>Playful</b> but not marketing-y

<h2>How Stellar speaks</h2>

<b>Tone.</b> Accessible but thoughtful. Concise, straightforward. 

<b>Diction.</b> Clear and crisp, without any technical jargon. Writing for modularity and localization is a chief concern, so no portmanteaus or American/British colloquialisms.

<b>Syntax.</b> Conversational rather than robotic. “We,” Stellar, speak directly to “you,” the developer or user. Use contractions! (And, occasionally, exclamation points.)

<b>Wit.</b> As individuals, we may be quirky and eccentric and sarcastic (<i>Nooo, never</i>). As an organization, Stellar conveys personality in ways other than humor or irony, which are difficult to scale and often don’t translate.

<h2>Stroopy</h2>
An alien named for the stroopwafel, the Dutch cookie and beloved snack of Stellar.org employees, Stroopy is Stellar's signature explorer. 

<h4>Character</h4>
Stroopy is adventurous, an intrepid explorer who is passionate about conquering the unknown. Incisive and articulate, Stroopy enjoys debating visions of the future with friends (or strangers). A good-natured, peaceable alien, Stroopy believes that, if we use technology as a force for good, anything is possible. 

<h4>Appearance</h4> 
1. Stroopy always wears a helmet. (Aliens come from outer space, after all.) 
2. Stroopy has no recongnizable gender or nationality. 

Aside from these two essential visual traits, Stroopy's appearance can change. Like the Stellar network—and the <a href = "https://octodex.github.com/">GitHub Octocat</a>—Stroopy can be adopted by anyone, anywhere.
