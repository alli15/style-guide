<h1>Stellar Style: A Guide</h1>

<i>This guide is a work in progress.</i>

<h2>About this guide</h2>

Good writing is the sum of many technical decisions. This guide helps writers at Stellar.org and in the larger Stellar community make good decisions. In it, we describe the parameters and specific rules—including punctuation, grammar, and other facets of writerly style—that govern Stellar.org’s voice. 

As a living document, this style guide is constantly evolving. If you’re looking for something that isn’t here or have a question about implementing these rules, talk to <a href = "https://github.com/jessica-collier">Jessica</a>.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
Watch for changes as we continue to flesh out this style guide. 

Opportunities for contribution will be more abundant in the future. For now, we love feedback. Give it on Twitter (<a href = "https://twitter.com/verbagetruck">@verbagetruck</a>, <a href = "https://twitter.com/StellarOrg">@StellarOrg</a>) or via email (jessica at stellar dot org).
