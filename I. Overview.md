<h2>Principles for Stellar voice</h2>

We’re always frank and straightforward.

We’re helpful and encouraging.

We’re truthful, and we’ve got integrity. Stellar has a point of view on financial inclusion but maintains objectivity around the tools and services built on the Stellar network. 

<h2>Writing basics</h2>

Tell your audience what’s going on, clearly and concisely.

Never call users “users” to their face. (See below.)

Address the audience as “you.” 

Half as long, twice as good.

Avoid passive voice at nearly all costs.

Use contractions.

Kill technical jargon.

Think twice about listing three things.

Don’t use “and more.”

Write simply but not simplistically, so a twelve-year-old could understand.

<h2>Tips for revising</h2>

1. Step away from the first draft. Revise when you’re fresh.

2. Read what you wrote out loud.

3. Ask a colleague to read your draft. Accomplished writers need feedback, too. Nothing should be published without review by multiple pairs of eyes.
